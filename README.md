# Shark Attax

## Inspiration
We wanted to make something for all the shark lovers out there, all the people who adore the IKEA blahaj. Hence, a project that tests you on all things shark and lets you talk like a shark!

## What it does
Our project lets you talk to a bot on Telegram, which will spit out shark related trivia. The bot can also quiz you on shark trivia. Our project also has a chatroom, so that people can talk about sharks in an anonymous manner.

## How we built it
The telegram bot portion of our project was built using Python and connects to Telegram. The chatroom portion was built using React. Appwrite was used to store the chatroom data and the quiz answers data.

##  Best Use of Appwrite
We used appwrite in a lot of way, we used it to store the chat data and moderate it, the answers of the quiz question and the scores are stored in the database of appwrite, we used it to authenticate in the telegram so that the  we can manage a leaderboard as well.

## Challenges we ran into
We had timezone related issues, since not everyone was in the same timezone. We were all new to appwrite, and had to spend some time reading through its documentation. We also didn't have as much time as we expected to create the project, since we spent some time deliberating on what to do.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to push through the challenges and work on our project.
We were able to complete the project we thought of initially in the given time frame
